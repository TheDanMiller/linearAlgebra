linearAlgebra
=============

This is the start of a linear algebra toolkit that I wrote for my linear algebra professor in college.  It could use some work both visually and functionally.  It currently performs row reduction only.

### Features that could be implemented
- Show the reduction in steps by writing it out to the bottom of the page
- Calculating the inverse of the matrix
- Linear Dependence / Independence

### Contribute
- Fork
- Branch
- Pull Request
- Have Fun
